# Insouciant

Now I recognize that sound computer science practices dictate that all code
should strive to handle, on some level, all exceptions that may come up.

The reality is there are cases when you may not be aware, let alone in control
of all the possible sources of errors. Sometimes, it would be nice to have
your troublesome code run, and NOT bring the house down because some host is
unreachable or some other error beyond your control.

The insouciant gem allows for just a use case.

The single method in this gem, Object::insouciant allows code to be run in a
simple and care free manner.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'insouciant'
